# Airline-Ticketing-and-Baggage-System
## Programming Techniques (COSC1284) Assignment 2- RMIT University
An object oriented console application written solely in the Java programming language for an imaginary airline company for their ticketing and baggage system as part of the Programming Techniques Assignment 2 at RMIT University. 

The project tested us on our object oriented programming skills, exception handling, File I/O and we had to work in some limitations as we were not allowed to use arraylist and more advanced java libraries. The project was done solo.

Obtained marks: 115/140
